# Procoder

In today's world, everything is becoming digitalized, and the use of paper is gradually diminishing with each passing day. It is not uncommon to miss out on important reading material due to the reliance on physical books and online videos. While certain institutions make use of dedicated file-hosting sites and clouds, there remains a clear need for a specialized system. The proposed system aims to fulfill this need.

Aims to address the issue of missing important content due to the shift towards digital platforms and the decreasing use of physical paper-based materials. With the prevalence of online books and videos, it is easy to overlook or forget about essential reading materials.



### There are some criteria:
```
1. The insufficient space leads to overlapping content.
2. It is difficult to stay updated with the latest posts.
3. You are unable to track the number of people who viewed your post.
4. Direct access to the read post is unavailable.
5. It is exhausting to constantly check notices for new posts.
6. Accessibility issues and various other limitations are prevalent on traditional websites.
7. Therefore, adopting the proposed pro-coder is necessary to digitize the reading experience and address the limitations associated with traditional methods.
Hence, it caters to the challenges posed by conventional approaches, offering an online solution.
